The ShopV5.0 Utilities code is here and the class structure is:

You can choose to add additional validation methods to this
 class should you wish.

Regardless, just add the code above to your project,
into your utils package and use it like we have been doing
 in labs. Refer to ShopV5.0 to see it in action as well as
 Topic05 materials.
